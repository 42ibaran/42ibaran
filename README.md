# #OpenToWork!

I am a technology enthusiast with 2 years of professional experience in backend development and automation, now advancing my education with a focus on data and machine learning. I see technology as a tool for transformation and aim to use my skills and agility in projects that drive meaningful change in areas like sustainability, health care, education, and community. **Currently, I am looking for a freelance mission or a permanent position.**

## Technical skills 💻

My primary coding language is **Python**. I am experienced with **JavaScript, C, and PHP**. I also use **Pandas and NumPy, Docker, SQL, and Shell**.

## Scool projects

Pedagogical program at 42 is practice oriented, and student's progress depends on qantity and qauality of completed projects. Here are some of my school projects:

- [total_perspective_vortex](https://github.com/42ibaran/total_perspective_vortex)
EEG-based BCI classifier able to distinguish between motor/imagery tasks.

- [DSLR](https://github.com/42ibaran/dslr):
Machine Learning model for multinomial classification using logistic regression with gradient descent.

- [Linear regression](https://github.com/42ibaran/ft_linear_regression):
Machine Learning model for predicting car price based on its mileage using linear regression (dah) with gradient descent.

- [Computor V1](https://github.com/42ibaran/computor_v1):
Program for solving polynomial equations.

## Courses 
### Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI
##### March 2023

This 3-course specialization in Machine Learning equipped me with the necessary skills to build and train various supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning models, including linear regression and logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks. I also learned best practices for Machine Learning development in practical applications.
